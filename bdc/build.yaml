# Template for bdc build YAML file.
#
# NOTE: This file contains only the configuration information for a particular
# class. bdc uses a separate configuration file to define the build environment
# for ALL courseware builds.

# course_info: Basic information about the course being built.
#
# FIELDS:
#
# name            - the name of the course (e.g., Spark-Programming). Should
#                   not have any white space in the name, as the name will be
#                   used to construct file names. REQUIRED.
# version         - semantic version number of the course (e.g., 1.0.1). See
#                   semver.org for a discussion of semantic versioning.
#                   REQUIRED.
# class_setup     - path to the (PDF) class setup instructions (for site
#                   managers of a given training site) on how to prepare the
#                   classroom environment. For Databricks and New Circle
#                   classes, a survey exists for this purpose. However, for
#                   partners, this document summarizes the minimum needs.
#                   The path is relative to the directory containing this build
#                   file. This file will be copied to the top of the destination
#                   directory. OPTIONAL.
# schedule        - path to a document (PDF, spreadsheet) that describes the
#                   recommended teaching schedule for the class. The path
#                   is relative to the directory containing this build file.
#                   This file will be copied to "InstructorFiles/<schedule>"
#                   in the destination directory. OPTIONAL.
# prep            - path to a Markdown document that outlines any instructor
#                   preparation that must be done before teaching the class.
#                   This file is copied to "InstructorFiles/Preparation.md" in
#                   the destination directory, and it is converted to HTML and
#                   copied to "InstructorFiles/Preparation.html". OPTIONAL.
# deprecated      - If present and true, this field marks the course as
#                   deprecated (i.e., no longer used). Attempts to build the
#                   course will fail.
course_info:

  version: version
  deprecated: false


# notebook_heading defines how the notebook heading is handled.
#
# path    - Path to a file containing Markdown and/or HTML, to be used as the
#           first cell in all generated notebooks. If not specified, the
#           default will be used.
# enabled - false to disable the automatic addition of a notebook header to
#           generated notebooks. true (the default) to add the header.

notebook_heading:
  #path: /path/to/somewhere
  #enabled: true

# notebook_heading -
#notebook_heading: /path/to/somewhere

# By default, the directories containing the labs are deleted once the
# corresponding DBC files are created. You can set this field to "true"
# to override that behavior.
keep_lab_dirs: false

# Markdown configuration
#
# html_stylesheet - path to an HTML stylesheet to include, inline, in any HTML
#                   generated from Markdown. OPTIONAL.
markdown:
  #html_stylesheet:

# src_base: Location of the base directory for the source curriculum
# material, relative to the location of THIS FILE. This will almost always
# be "../../modules". REQUIRED.
src_base: ../../modules

# misc_files: Files that should be copied to the course directory. Paths
# are relative to THIS FILE (not to <src_base>). These files are copied to
# the destination directory and, if Markdown, also converted to HTML.
#
# FIELDS:
#
# src   - source path to the file to be copied, relative to the directory
#         containing this build file. REQUIRED.
# dest  - destination path, relative to the top course directory. REQUIRED.
# skip  - true to skip this entry, false to keep it. This field is a convenient
#         alternative to commenting the entire entry out.
#         OPTIONAL. Default: false
#
# SUBSTITUTIONS:
#
# In the <dest> value, the following substitution tokens are permitted:
#
# ${basename}  - the base file name of the source, WITHOUT the extension
# ${filename}  - the base file name of the source, WITH the extension
# ${extension} - the file extension

# notebooks: The notebooks to be included in the courseware. These notebooks
# will be parsed and stored in a DBC file. In addition, any files within
# the notebook directories that start with "Instructor-Notes" will be copied,
# as well.
#
# WARNING: The notebooks should be encoded in ASCII or UTF-8. Other encodings
# (e.g., ISO-8859.1) will cause the build to abort.
#
# FIELDS:
#
# src        - path to the notebook, relative to <src_base>. REQUIRED.
#
# dest       - the destination path within the DBC file and within the
#              StudentFiles/Labs directory.
#
#              For a non-master notebook, this destination is the path to the
#              notebook's destination (relative to StudentFiles/Labs) and must
#              be a file.
#
#              For a master notebook, this value must be a directory and
#              specifies the base directory for the output notebooks (relative
#              to the top of the DBC file and StudentFiles/Labs). Individual
#              language notebook destinations can be further controlled within
#              the "master" section. (Note that answer notebooks, if enabled,
#              are always moved to InstructorFiles/Answer-Labs and placed in
#              the instructor's DBC file, not the students' DBC file.)
#
#              For master notebooks, ${target_lang} can be used to substitute
#              post-parsed final (target) language into the path. If missing,
#              ${target_lang} is inserted at the BEGINNING of the path. For
#              instance:
#
#              dest: "overview/${target_lang}/nb-01"  # explicit
#              dest: "overview/nb-01"  # same as "${target_lang}/overview/notebook-01"
#
#              If you want to suppress the target language entirely (e.g.,
#              because you're only using one language), start the
#              path with a "/" (meaning "starting from the top of the DBC")
#              and don't include ${target_lang}.
#
#              REQUIRED.
#
# skip       - true to skip this entry, false to keep it. This field is a
#              convenient alternative to commenting the entire entry out.
#              OPTIONAL. Default: false
#
# master     - If this section is present, it marks the notebook as a master
#              notebook to be processed by the master parse tool, and it
#              contain master parse parameters. If this section is missing,
#              then the notebook is not preprocessed; it's simply copied.
#              the master parse tool; false otherwise. OPTIONAL.
#
#              The following parameters are supported.
#
#              Note: When master parsing is enabled, instructor, exercises
#              and answer notebooks are ALWAYS generated.
#
#   enabled          - true to enable master processing, false to disable.
#                      Default: false.
#
#                      The easiest way to enable master processing with all the
#                      defaults is:
#
#                      master:
#                        enabled: true
#
#   answers          - whether or not to generate answer notebooks. True by default.
#   scala            - true to generate a Scala notebook. True by default.
#   python           - true to generate a Python notebook. True by default.
#   r                - true to generate an R notebook. False by default.
#   sql              - true to generate an SQL notebook. False by default.
#   encoding_in      - the encoding to use when reading the master notebook.
#                      Defaults to UTF-8
#   encoding_out     - the encoding to use when writing the output notebooks.
#                      Defaults to UTF-8
#
# run_test   - Whether or not to test the dataset by running it in a cluster
#              within a shard. The shard and cluster configuration are specified
#              in the build tool's master configuration, which is separate
#              from this courseware build manifest. OPTIONAL. Defaults to false.
#              (NOTE: NOT YET SUPPORTED.)
#
# SUBSTITUTIONS:
#
# In the <dest> value, the following substitution tokens are permitted:
#
# ${basename}    - the base file name of the source, WITHOUT the extension
# ${filename}    - the base file name of the source, WITH the extension
# ${extension}   - the file extension
# ${target_lang} - substitute the notebook language (Scala, R, etc.)
