# Change Log for Master Parse Tool

**Version 1.23.0**

- If a cell has multiple LANGUAGE_ONLY (e.g. PYTHON_ONLY and SCALA_ONLY), it will include it if the notebook
  language matches any of them.

**Version 1.22.0**

- Added `INSTRUCTOR_NOTES` alias for `INSTRUCTOR_NOTE`. Addresses
  [Issue #92](https://github.com/databricks-edu/build-tooling/issues/92).

**Version 1.21.0**

- Added `INSTRUCTOR_ONLY` alias for `INSTRUCTOR_NOTE`. Addresses
  [Issue #86](https://github.com/databricks-edu/build-tooling/issues/86).

**Version 1.20.0**

- Added support for a new `PROFILES` tag that allows arbitrary profiles, not
  just Amazon and Azure. `AMAZON_ONLY` and `AZURE_ONLY` are still supported,
  for backward compatibility.
- Added the ability to consolidate all instructor notes in a notebook into a
  single file.
- Fixed bug leading to extra blank lines in native code cells under certain
  circumstances.

**Version 1.19.0**

- Mustache parsing logic now contains some simple checks for bad Mustache
  template syntax. It will detect, and issue warnings, for the following
  incorrect Mustache substitutions:
    - `{{tag}` (missing a closing brace)
    - `{{#tag}` (missing a closing brace)
    - `{{/tag}` (missing a closing brace)
    - `{tag}}` (missing opening brace)
    - `{#tag}}` (missing opening brace)
    - `{/tag}}` (missing opening brace)

- Added the following Mustache tests:
    - `{{#self_paced}}self-paced-only content{{/self-paced}}`: Emits the
      specified content if the build is for self-paced curriculum; omits the
      content if the build is for ILT curriculum.         
    - `{{#ilt}}instructor led-only content{{/ilt}}`: Emits the specified content 
      if the build is for ILT curriculum; omits the content if the build is for 
      self-paced curriculum.         

- A revealable hints section can now have no hints (i.e., just the revealable
  answer.)

**Version 1.18.0**

The Mustache templates now support `{{#scala}}`, `{{#sql}}`, `{{#python}}`
and `{{#r}}` tests, which can be used to include conditional content based
on the output language.

**Version 1.17.0**

Extended the Mustache templates to support revealable hints. See the
[README](README.md#incrementally-revealable-hints) for details.

**Version 1.16.0**

If templates are enabled (the `--template` command line parameter, or an
option in the `Params` object for the API call), Markdown cells are run through
a [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) template processor.
This step allows conditional text and variable substitution.

**Version 1.15.2:**

Fixed a runnable TODO cell bug: Using a label (e.g., `ALL_NOTEBOOKS`) in a 
runnable TODO cell did not work properly. The additional label was 
uncommented (e.g., `// ALL_NOTEBOOKS` became just `ALL_NOTEBOOKS`) and then 
wasn't removed from the generated output, because it no longer matched the 
label pattern. For example, a cell like this:

```
%sql
-- TODO
-- ALL_NOTEBOOKS
-- SELECT <FILL_IN> 
```

was rendered as:

```
%sql
-- TODO
ALL_NOTEBOOKS
SELECT <FILL_IN> 
```

**Version 1.15.1:**

- `VIDEO` didn't work in conjunction with `SELF_PACED_ONLY` and `ILT_ONLY`.
  Now it does.

**Version 1.15.0:**

- Added `ILT_ONLY`, `SELF_PACED_ONLY` and `SOURCE_ONLY` tags.

**Version 1.14.0:**

* Added support for runnable TODO cells.

**Version 1.13.3:**

* Reformatted debug output slightly.

**Version 1.13.2:**

* Fixed a bug in the handling of inline tokens that led to cells being
  suppressed or mis-marked with the `%md-sandbox` under certain circumstances.
* Fixed a bug where a cell with a keyword (e.g., `// AMAZON_ONLY`) _and_
  a `// VIDEO` label failed to get rid of the keyword.
  
**Version 1.13.1:**

* Updated output for `-- VIDEO` to fix some issues.

**Version 1.13.0:**

* Added support for `AZURE_ONLY` and `AMAZON_ONLY` tags, triggered
  by `--target-profile` command line argument.

**Version 1.12.3:**

* Added border around video player.

**Version 1.12.2:**

* Updated generated S3 links to point to `files.training.databricks.com`.
* Updated style for header image.

**Version 1.12.1:**

* Changed default header image.

**Version 1.12.0:**

* ALLOW --ANSWER in markdown cells.  This addresses a usecase where we want
  additional documentation that appears only in answer notebooks to explain
  a solution.

**Version 1.11.2:**

* Default footer now includes a support link.

**Version 1.11.1:**

* Master parser now emits `%scala`, `%python`, `%r`, `%sql`, `%markdown` 
  and `%markdown-sandbox` on their own lines (i.e., any cell content starts
  on the second line of the cell). Previously, it only did so for `%scala`,
  `%python` and `%r`. With other "magic" cells (`%run`, `%fs`, `%sh`), the
  cell content starts on the same line as the magic token.
* Changed insertion of Creative Commons license (`-cc` option) to ensure that
  the license cell is `%md-markdown`, not `%md`.
* Fixed incorrect formatting when both the Databricks training heading and the
  Creative Commons license are selected.

**Version 1.11.0:**

* Fixed footer logic to handle Scala (i.e., to use the proper language-specific)
  comment syntax.
* Added `--notebook-footer` and `--footer` arguments to control the generated
  footer (both the content and whether the footer is added). Consistent with
  `--notebook-heading` and `--heading`, the footer is off by default.
* Added `--copyright YEAR` option, to specify the copyright year that is
  substituted into the default footer.

**Version 1.10.0:**

* Added automatic copyright footer to generated notebooks.

**Version 1.9.0:**

* Video tag is now `-- VIDEO id [title]`, where `id` is a video ID. Videos
  are now assumed to reside on Wistia.com.
* `:HINT:` now expands to an image and text, not just text.
* `:NOTE:` has been removed. (Use `:SIDENOTE:`, instead.)
* `:KEYPOINT:`, `:INSIGHT:`, `:WARNING` have been removed.
* Fixed code that renders inline tokens (`:HINT:`, etc.) to render them in
  `%md-sandbox` if necessary.

**Version 1.8.0**

* Added support for inline callouts. The tokens `:HINT:`, `:CAUTION:`, 
  `:WARNING:`,`:BESTPRACTICE:`, `:KEYPOINT:`, `:SIDENOTE:`, and `:INSIGHT:`
  are replaced, inline, with appropriate expansions.

**Version 1.7.2:**

* Fixes to handle both `%r` and `%md-sandbox`.

**Version 1.7.1:**

* Updates to fix handling of `%run`. **Breaks `%r`!**

**Version 1.7.0:**

* Add cell validity checks that ensure that some commands can only appear
  in certain cells.
* `TEST` cells can now have an annotation after the word `TEST`, and if
  the annotation is missing, the tool adds one. Thus, in a code cell,
  the line `TEST - You can use this cell to test your solution` will be
  emitted as is, but the cell `TEST` will be transformed to
  `TEST - Run this cell to test your solution`. 
  
**Version 1.6.0:**

* Removed `NOTEBOOK_HEADING` command, in favor of `--heading` command
  line option that automatically adds the heading as the first cell in
  generated notebooks.

**Version 1.5.0:**

* Added support for `VIDEO <url> <title>` command.
* Updated format of default notebook heading.
* Deprecated the `DATABRICKS_ONLY` command.
* Un-deprecated the `PRIVATE_TEST` command.

**Version 1.4.1:**

* Fixed bug where notebook heading wasn't properly generated.
* Changed `TRAINING_HEADING` to the more general-purpose `NOTEBOOK_HEADING`.
* Changed `-th` (`--training-heading`) option to `-nh` (`--notebook-heading`),
  and made corresponding API changes.

**Version 1.4.0:**

* Added `TRAINING_HEADING` command, which replaces the (Markdown) cell in
  which it appears with a standard heading.
* Added a `-th` (`--training-heading`) command line option that permits
  overriding the standard heading with the contents of some other file.

**Version 1.3.1:**

* Fixed a bug causing a mishandling of any language cell (e.g., `%sql`, `%r`)
  that has the `ALL_NOTEBOOKS` _and_ one of `TODO` or `ANSWER`.

**Version 1.3.0:**

* Master parser now generates _three_ broad kinds of notebooks: instructor, 
  exercises, and answers. 
    - The _exercises_ notebook is what used to be called the "student" notebook.
      It omits any cells marked `ANSWER`, and it omits any `INSTRUCTOR_NOTE`
      cells.
    - The _instructor_ notebook is what used to be called the "answers" notebook.
      It omits any `TODO` cells, contains all `ANSWER` cells, and contains
      reformatted `INSTRUCTOR_NOTE` cells.
    - The _answers_ notebook is almost identical to the _instructor_ notebook,
      except that it does not contain `INSTRUCTOR_NOTE` cells.
* Added deprecation warnings for `PRIVATE_TEST`, `INLINE` and 
  `IPYTHON_ONLY` labels.
* Added change log.
